So far i have completed learning how to clone the github repo locally and work in that, So here are the few git commands i learnt today,
1) git clone < repo url>
2) git add 
3) git commit -m "Type your commit message"
4) git push origin main

Finally to bring all the modified content to the vscode, you will need to use a command
5) git pull
